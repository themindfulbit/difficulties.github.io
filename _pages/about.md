My name is Erik Hess, and I'm a designer, developer, and recovering fighter pilot living in Carson City, Nevada. 

If this is your first visit, here are a few posts to get you started:

## About the Author

I spent thirteen years on active duty in the US Navy, flying [Tomcats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-14_Tomcat) and [Super Hornets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_F/A-18E/F_Super_Hornet) off aircraft carriers. The most rewarding part was teaching others to do it too as a [Landing Signal Officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_signal_officer). For a short time after leaving active duty I flew [Tigers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_F-5) in the Navy Reserve, after which I served at a lower altitude and speed until retiring.

Outside the Navy, I'm a defense analyst for a rapidly growing [consulting firm](http://2circleinc.com). Previously I worked at [high90](http://high90.com) and collaborated with [Gabe Weatherhead](http://macdrifter.com) on a few cool projects like [NerdQuery](http://nerdquery.com), [CriticMarkup](http://criticmarkup.com), and *Generational*, a podcast on the late, great 70 Decibels network. With the help of [Potatowire](http://with.thegra.in), Gabe and I made *Technical Difficulties*. A little more recently, Potatowire and I recorded [Seasons of Obsession](http://seasons.fm). I’m not very active on social media, but when I am you can find me here:

## About the Site

In late 2011 I built the first iteration of *The Mindful Bit*. It now has a different name that better reflects my struggle to understand the world. I'm still fascinated by the intersection of mindfulness, technology, and design. I'm still puzzled by the world's impermanent, emergent, and unsatisfying nature. I'll be working on mindfulness for the rest of my life. While I don't have any good answers, in the meantime we can have enlightening conversations around the questions.

The site itself has been rebuilt six times, using [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com), [WordPress](http://wordpress.org), [Squarespace](http://squarespace.com), [Ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com), [Statamic](http://statamic.com), and now [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) hosted via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It's currently typeset in Georg Duffner's elegant [EB Garamond](http://www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond/). I use the site to play around with new web technologies, so it changes a lot. I hope that doesn't get too annoying for you.

These thoughts &ndash; however little they're worth &ndash; are my own and not those of my past or current employers. [We are what we do](https://www.uuworld.org/articles/zen-koan-baizhangs-fox), not who we claim to be. This site is no exception.
