My good friend [Potatowire](https://micro.blog/potatowire) has relaunched his blog *[This Will Be Hard](https://twbh.io/index.html)*. I'm glad he did. The world needs more voices like his &ndash; calm, reasoned, and open-minded.

Here's a great example, from *[Routine](https://twbh.io/posts/routine.html)*: 

> When I kicked this project off, I had time to write late in the day, but it quickly became evident (by two days in row of bad work) that late-day creative energy was too rare for me to rely on. So, instead I started writing in the morning, after my hard reading was complete.
> 
> This seemed like it would work well, until I noticed (as in my wife told me) that I was a bit of a jerk to my family throughout the rest of the day. Writing and finalizing the posts first-thing was the only common thread in two days of bad behavior, and I think maintaining my focus while my family vied for it was too great a strain. I chose poorly in letting the writing win-out.

I've had this exact experience, and it's not something I've yet found a way to overcome. Having a train of thought derailed is extremely frustrating, and unfortunately my only solution has been not writing (at least here). That's not the answer, but being a jerk to the people around me isn't either.

In the meantime, I'll be looking forward to more of *This Will Be Hard*. Check it out, and if you like it as much as I do, be sure to [let him know](https://micro.blog/potatowire).
