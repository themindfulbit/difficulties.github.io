It's been a while, which says as much about the turmoil within as without. The churn that happens behind the scenes always seems to dwarf whatever happens on the outside, like some kind of mental iceberg. 

Writing has been an excellent refuge for me as long as I've actually *done* it. The words that course through my head need some sort of outlet, and putting a pen to paper (or fingers to keys) offers a place to trap them -- like an ancient spider in amber -- so they can be examined or abandoned at some later time.

Recently, I've returned to the written page after two decades spent gazing into glowing screens. I'd forgotten many of the things that made the written word (as opposed to the typed one) so compelling and, to be fair, frustrating. Putting a pen or pencil to paper has a permanence the digital world deeply lacks. Mistakes stay, even when crossed out.  Editing means writing something again, differently, elsewhere. On the other hand the permanence of the page is extremely local, where the impermanence of the screen is now global. My paper mistakes will remain on that one page until it crumbles or burns. Thanks to [Archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20111129175657/http://themindfulbit.com/), mistakes in the digital world can live forever, everywhere -- possibly transformed, but not lost or forgotten save in some unforseen digital armageddon.

One nice thing about a notebook is that it only gives back the things you put into it. Nothing on the page will change on its own. Nobody else's thoughts will intrude there without your action. Nothing blinks, flashes, or moves in a desperate plea for your attention. It's unlikely that your notebook is going to try to convince you of something or take away something you value (although it may try to [sell you a subscription](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/)). There are so few places left in this busy world that are truly yours. It's nice to have a place where you can safely, quietly, locally, enjoy a moment of solitude and space.

I started rediscovering these things around four years ago on my last deployment. Looking for a way to keep track of things when my electronics had to be left at the door, a friend suggested that I look into the [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/) method. Ryder's approach to paper immediately resonated with me. When my journal fails, it's usually because I've strayed from his simple, straightforward recommendations. The practice of writing down the essentials, letting compulsive organization go, and getting out of my own way helped me make progress against the perfectionism that halted earlier journals in their tracks.

More important, Bullet Journaling showed me that there was a way to organize the information around me without a constellation of distracting, networked devices constantly clawing for my attention. By showed, I mean *reminded* of course. I'm old enough to have gone through nearly my entire education without a computer or the internet. 

Somehow I survived.

What I don't remember was a system that made sense of all the paper information around us. I remember Franklin Covey and Filofax, but I don't remember methodologies like [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) or Bullet Journaling to help make it all come together in an intelligible way. While it may not be exactly ironic that we needed a digital revolution to figure out how to organize our paper products *and communicate that to the world*, I still find it a bit funny.

Whether in digital or analog life, there have certainly been pitfalls along the way. The most dangerous for me has been refinement: a desire to have something a bit nicer than what's in front of me, and certainly nicer than what's strictly required. Windows gave way to Linux, then the Mac. Flip phones gave way to the iPhone. Pencils and ballpoints gave way to rollerballs, gel pens, fancy Japanese *micro* gel pens, and now fountain pens. Meade gave way to Moleskine, Leuchtturm, Midori, Nanami. 

Through each of these changes and upgrades the core of what I actually *did* never improved unless I put in time and attention. What I do today on a Mac, iPhone, fountain pen and Tomoe River paper could just have easily been done on a decade-old Windows machine, a grocery store spiral notebook and a Bic Crystal, probably with a lot less smearing.

What does this say about how I've lived my life and engaged with the world around me? Why did it take this long to discover that the only things I really need are right in front of me? That in the long run, obsessing about the next greatest *anything* is the biggest obstacle to *actual progress* you can find? And to be clear, it's just as silly to reject the fountain pen in front of you and go buy a pack of Bics at the store. Whatever *you have* is good enough, even if it's a stick and the dirt outside. 

Make something. Write something. Do something. 

Leave the world better, not by buying or consuming, but by making it happen with what's on hand, even if it's just your own voice saying hello to a stranger.

It's taken most of my life to realize that nearly all the obstacles I've faced were placed there by me or with my acquiesence. Most of them appeared as artificial prerequisites, deeply unnecessary for what really mattered, offering only a way to avoid trying the things I thought I'd fail. It's not enough to just recognize the problem. We can't grow until we allow ourselves to fail and make ourselves try again, and again, and again.

For now, for me, that failure happens mostly on fancy paper with a few not-terribly-expensive fountain pens. It's aided by an iPhone and XPS 15 stripped of many non-essential or distracting applications. When boredom strikes, I can pull out my long-neglected guitar, or go for a walk, or sit down and write again, and again, and again... and make the same mistakes -- in one medium or another -- again and again and again.

Maybe if we all keep doing that long enough, there will be a little improvement. 

Maybe making the mistakes and trying again *is* the improvement. 

Let's find out.
