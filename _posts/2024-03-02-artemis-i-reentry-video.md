Somehow I missed this [dramatic video](https://images.nasa.gov/details/art001m1203451716) of the [Artemis I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_1) [Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_\(spacecraft\)) spacecraft reentering the atmosphere after its uncrewed trip around the moon.

I hadn't really processed the tremendous speeds involved in the spacecraft's return from the moon until I watched the following animations tracing its flight path using [inertial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference) and [rotating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_reference_frame) reference frames.

The spacecraft was traveling nearly 40,000 km/h (25,000 mph) when it first entered the upper atmosphere. After using a skip-style [non-ballistic reentry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-ballistic_atmospheric_entry) to bleed off excess speed (the two deceleration phases are quite apparent in the video) the spacecraft deployed its parachutes for a successful splashdown.

[Artemis II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_2) is scheduled to take four astronauts back to the moon sometime after September 2025.
