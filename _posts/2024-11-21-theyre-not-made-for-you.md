Security expert [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com) on a [new piece](https://www.404media.co/email/f459caa7-1a58-4f31-a9ba-3cb53a5046a4/) from 404 Media:

For less benign outcomes, take a look at [China](https://theconversation.com/digital-surveillance-is-omnipresent-in-china-heres-how-citizens-are-coping-225628) or consult [Orwell](https://gizmodo.com/amazon-secretly-removes-1984-from-the-kindle-5317703).

As I dip my toes back into open source software, I'm reminded just how much effort it takes. Disturbingly, I've also noticed how much harder it is than before to run open-source operating systems on modern devices. There are so many security barriers baked in at the firmware level that bypassing and disabling them has become a significant challenge.

I urge all of us to consider what you use, how you use it, and who manages those platforms. Embrace the challenge of actively managing your digital environment.
